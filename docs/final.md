## Project Summary  
The StealthEscape project is focused on developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent within the Minecraft environment using the Project Malmo platform. The agent is tasked with navigating 
a maze, avoiding hazards such as lava pits, and evading zombie guards. The core objective is to optimize the agentâ€™s pathfinding strategy using RL, incorporating a combination of exploration and exploitation to efficiently navigate through the maze while avoiding detection. The agent is trained to make decisions based on its current state (position, light levels, and proximity to obstacles) and adapt its behavior to minimize the risk of falling into hazards or being caught by guards. By leveraging Q-learning and a reward-based system, the agent's actions are refined over time, improving its ability to achieve the mission's goal.
